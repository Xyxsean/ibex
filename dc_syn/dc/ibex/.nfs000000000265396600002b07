# Write a Standard Delay Format (SDF) file
# Note : SDF is an IEEE standard for the representation and interpretation of timing data
#        The SDF file includes delays (module path, device, interconnect, and port), timing checks (setup, hold, recovery, skew, width, and period),
#        timing constraints (path and skew), incremental and absolute delays, and so on
